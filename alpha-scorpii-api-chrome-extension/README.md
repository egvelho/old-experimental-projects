# A Chrome extension and REST API conceptual project to help people to do some studying

Extension for Google Chrome that periodically displays a question for you to answer. These questions are added by teachers who create them to help their students study for exams. As students answer the questions, a score is accumulated.

It's an old app that I created as a undergraduation project. It's not the best code in the world and the UI is really bad, but it's a pretty cool proposition.
