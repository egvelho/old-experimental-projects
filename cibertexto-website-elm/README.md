# A fully working Website written in Elm 0.18.

This is a production-ready (back in 2017 when it was coded, hahaha) SPA based on Elm 0.18 and Material Design Lite. It also have some backend written in Node.JS and Express.

# Demo

You can access the demo [site](https://egvelho.github.io/cibertexto-website-elm/) to see how it looks like. It was written in 2017, but I suspect it can still be adapted and used in production for very small websites, or at least for learning purposes.

# Getting started

Install the required packages using ```elm-package install``` and ```npm install```. For building, execute ```npm run build```. For the Express API, it may need some tweaks as it was and untested adaptation of a WebTask endpoint.
